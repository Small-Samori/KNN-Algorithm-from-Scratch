# Overview
In this project, a KNN algorithm was built from scratch (using numpy).
The algorithm was trained on UCI breast cancer dataset and its performance is comparable to Scikit-Learn's KNN algorithm
It achieved over 97% accuracy

# Dependencies
* Numpy
* Pandas

# Usage
1. `cd '\KNN Algorithm from Scratch' `
1. `python 'KNN algorithm.py'`
